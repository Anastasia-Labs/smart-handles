# Smart Beacons
Through the use of Smart Beacons & router scripts, users will be able to interact with DApps without going through their front-end or building the smart contract transactions themselves. 

Smart Beacons is a framework for routing transactions. It is essentially AdaHandles for Smart Contract addresses. Through this framework, swapping tokens on a dex will be as simple as sending funds to @ada-to-min (or whatever token pair you want).
